In this excersie I practiced tunig up my python skills and practiced learning new material such as dictionaries and functions
This exercice will help with making the next assignment, making a novel role playing game where you have a few choices that will bring you to different locations wiht different options
I still have to learn more before I am completely ready to dive into the assignment, but after working with thesee xercises I feel more confident with moving forward
